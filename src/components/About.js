                Hi, I’m Sato Haruto, a Senior Full Stack Web and Mobile
                Developer based in Tokyo, Japan. I have 6 years of experience
                building scalable, high-performance web and mobile applications
                for a wide range of industries. I specialize in modern frontend
                frameworks like React and Next.js, backend development with
                Node.js and NestJS, and cross-platform mobile development using
                React Native and Flutter.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                I’m passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly
                experiences while ensuring robust and maintainable code. I enjoy
                collaborating with cross-functional teams, mentoring junior
                developers, and leveraging cloud technologies to deliver
                reliable and innovative solutions. Outside of coding, I love
                exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source
                projects, and turning complex problems into simple, elegant
                solutions.
